# Discord-token-logger-Proof-of-Concept

Hi! Out of a boredom, I decided to take a day, and create this. I do know that there are a lot more token loggers that do exist, and they are a proof of concept of themselves, but I decided to make this, and upload it to GitHub to let others see how this kind of thing works.
